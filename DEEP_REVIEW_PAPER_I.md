### Experimental Design Complete Guide

#### True Experimental Design Example:

**Research Question**: Does a new teaching method improve test scores?

**Design**: Randomized Controlled Trial

**Procedure**:
1. **Random Assignment**: 100 students randomly assigned to:
   - Experimental group (n=50): New teaching method
   - Control group (n=50): Traditional method

2. **Pretest**: Both groups take baseline test

3. **Intervention**: 8 weeks of instruction

4. **Posttest**: Both groups take same test

5. **Analysis**: Compare posttest scores controlling for pretest

**Internal Validity Controls**:
- Random assignment → Controls selection bias
- Pretest → Controls initial differences
- Same instructor → Controls instructor effects
- Same materials → Controls content differences
- Same time → Controls history effects

**Results Interpretation**:
If experimental group scores significantly higher (p < 0.05), 
we can conclude the new method CAUSED improvement.

**Diagram**:
```
Random Assignment
    ↓
Experimental Group (n=50)  |  Control Group (n=50)
    ↓                      |       ↓
Pretest                    |   Pretest
    ↓                      |       ↓

### Complete Questionnaire Validation Process

#### Step 1: Literature Review and Item Generation
**Purpose**: Ground items in theory

**Process**:
1. Review existing validated scales
2. Identify theoretical dimensions
3. Generate initial item pool (2-3x final items)
4. Ensure coverage of all dimensions

**Example**: Measuring "Job Satisfaction"
- Dimensions: Pay, Work environment, Colleagues, Growth
- Initial items: 40 items (10 per dimension)

#### Step 2: Expert Review (Content Validity)
**Purpose**: Ensure items measure what they should

**Process**:
1. Select 5-10 experts in the field
2. Provide item pool and definitions
3. Experts rate relevance (1-4 scale)
4. Calculate Content Validity Index (CVI)

**CVI Calculation**:
CVI = (Number of experts rating 3 or 4) / (Total experts)
Acceptable: CVI > 0.78

**Example**:
Item: "I am satisfied with my salary"
- 8 out of 10 experts rate 3 or 4
- CVI = 8/10 = 0.80 ✅ Keep item

#### Step 3: Pilot Testing
**Purpose**: Test clarity and flow

**Sample**: 30-50 respondents similar to target
**Process**:
1. Administer questionnaire
2. Conduct cognitive interviews
3. Check completion time
4. Identify confusing items
5. Revise as needed

#### Step 4: Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
**Purpose**: Identify underlying dimensions

**Sample**: 200-300 respondents (5-10 per item)
**Process**:
1. Check KMO (> 0.6) and Bartlett's test (p < 0.05)
2. Extract factors (eigenvalue > 1)
3. Rotate factors (Varimax)
4. Examine factor loadings (> 0.4)
5. Remove items with:
   - Low loadings (< 0.4)
   - Cross-loadings (> 0.4 on multiple factors)

**Example Output**:
Factor 1 (Pay): Items 1, 2, 3, 4 (loadings: 0.75, 0.82, 0.79, 0.68)
Factor 2 (Environment): Items 5, 6, 7, 8 (loadings: 0.71, 0.85, 0.77, 0.73)

#### Step 5: Reliability Analysis (Cronbach's Alpha)
**Purpose**: Check internal consistency

**Acceptable**: α > 0.70

**Process**:
1. Calculate alpha for each dimension
2. Check item-total correlations
3. Remove items if "alpha if item deleted" increases

**Example**:
Pay dimension: α = 0.85 ✅
Environment dimension: α = 0.82 ✅

#### Step 6: Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
**Purpose**: Confirm factor structure

**Sample**: New sample of 200-300
**Process**:
1. Specify model based on EFA
2. Test model fit:
